## 2025-06-01 Conflict Between Shai (the Big Beard) and the Community

- Shai (the Big Beard) (https://x.com/DesheShai) holds a PhD in Mathematics, contributed to some of Kaspa's academic papers, and was formerly a core member of Kaspa.

- Had a falling out with KEF due to certain issues.

    * https://x.com/oneforonehaha/status/1929012576676937918

    * https://x.com/oneforonehaha/status/1929241485670588503

    * KEF (Kaspa Eco Foundation) is the ecosystem foundation for the Kaspa blockchain, aiming to accelerate the development, adoption, and sustainability of the Kaspa ecosystem, including smart contracts and ecosystem building.

- The core development team stated that Shai was no longer participating in core team work and that his comments no longer represented the core team's views. This dissatisfaction, possibly stemming from various misunderstandings, led to the final break.

    * https://x.com/DesheShai/status/1929668361111437812

    * Someone asked: "If the entire crypto industry's traffic moved to Kaspa, could Kaspa handle it?" Shai gave an affirmative answer. The core dev team considered this view inaccurate and feared the public might mistake it for the core team's official stance.

    * Shai felt he never claimed to represent the core team and was unhappy with the public distancing.

- He continues to participate in some discussions within the Kaspa community.

## 2025-07-01 Decentralization of the Official X Account

- In response to Yonatan's proposal for decentralization this year, the community decided to hand over the original official X account to a community member for maintenance.

:::

- Prior to this, the name of the "official" X account was temporarily changed to "Kaspa City" or other names, which dissatisfied the community.

- This led to the following vote:

    * The maintainer, Christian Ludwig (https://x.com/christi61026749), later changed the Kaspa official Twitter ID from `@KaspaCurrency` to `@kaspaunchained`.

    * His subsequent actions were even more puzzling...

    * https://x.com/kaspaunchained

- Regardless, this account was effectively rendered obsolete. In a way, "decentralization" was achieved.

- Many people started creating their own Kaspa promotion accounts, such as:

## 2025-09-11 vProg Protocol Yellow Paper Release

### (1). vProg Introduction

- https://x.com/michaelsuttonil/status/1966134048209908215

- https://github.com/kaspanet/research/blob/main/vProgs/vProgs_yellow_paper.pdf

::: info Yellow Paper Summary:

The vProg protocol is a revolutionary blockchain scaling solution. Its core innovation is **resolving the fundamental conflict between application (vProg) "sovereignty" and "composability" without sacrificing the underlying decentralized security**.

**1. Solving the Core Conflict: Sovereignty vs. Composability**

*   **Traditional Dilemma**: If applications maintain independent sovereignty (managing their own state, isolated from interference), achieving efficient synchronous interaction (composability) becomes very difficult. Conversely, forcing them together for composability creates performance bottlenecks and loss of sovereignty.

*   **vProg's Goal**: To enable thousands of decentralized applications to interact **securely and atomically in real-time, as if on a single chain**, while each application maintains a high degree of independence and censorship resistance, thereby forming a powerful, non-fragmented unified economy.

**2. Paradigm Shift: From "Global Execution" to "Local Verification"**

The protocol's core innovation lies in role separation and proof mechanisms:

*   **L1 as the "Trust Anchor"**: The Kaspa mainnet retreats from "computing" all programs to acting as **neutral infrastructure**, responsible for:
    *   **Ordering & Data Availability**: Determining transaction order and ensuring data is available.
    *   **Dependency Calculation**: Acting like a traffic controller, precisely calculating which vProgs a transaction will "affect" (defining the "computational scope") and metering resources to prevent network congestion.

*   **vProg's "Sovereign Execution"**: When a vProg (A) needs to interact with another vProg (B), Node A **does not passively wait for B's reply**. Instead, it **actively simulates the execution of B's code locally**. This ensures A's operation never stalls due to B's failure.

*   **ZK Proofs as the "Trust Foundation"**: The correctness of the local execution result is not judged subjectively but is verified cryptographically by **zero-knowledge proofs**. Any node can quickly verify the proof's authenticity, thereby trusting the local execution result.

**3. Key Mechanism for Unlimited Scaling**

*   **State Anchor Shallowing**: The more frequently a vProg submits state proofs to the mainnet, the less historical data other nodes need to traverse to verify its current state (the anchor becomes "shallower"). This reduces the burden of cross-program interaction, making the overall system lighter and more efficient.

*   **Incentive-Driven Proof Market**: This creates a natural economic demand, fostering a professional, competitive market for prover services. Provers profit by frequently submitting proofs, while passively maintaining the high performance and scalability of the entire network.

**Ultimate Vision:**

The vProg protocol aims to build a system of "sovereign network effects": each application is an independent kingdom (sovereign), but through a set of cryptographically guaranteed universal rules, these kingdoms can trade and cooperate seamlessly and securely as if on one continent (composability). The foundation bearing all this (Kaspa L1)始终保持其去中心化的坚固本质 (maintains its decentralized, robust nature).

:::

- vProg will enable smart contract protocols to be deployed directly without relying on L2 smart contract platforms.

### (2). Yonatan's View on Traditional L2s

- Yonatan dislikes the L2 design, believing that L2s do not feedback and benefit L1 miners. Therefore, he led the design of vProg to address this issue.

::: tip Yonatan's post discussing Layer 2:

- **Post:** https://x.com/hashdag/status/1972383422204305492

- **Translation:** I (Yonatan) know almost nothing about Kaspa's Layer 2 solutions (L2s) and am unaware of why they were created. Therefore, understanding their architecture, codebase transparency, etc., holds no value for me. **I consider L2s an unwise path, risking a repetition of Ethereum's mistakes, and I have voiced this concern for years (refer to my writings on atomic composability vs. fragmentation).** To address this, the Kaspa core team has long been working on a built-in L2 design—in short, a computation layer verified by zero-knowledge proofs, tightly integrated with L1 consensus: it receives opcode and data structure support from L1, while offloading computation and, more critically, state data away from L1. This is the only "L2" architecture in the entire cryptocurrency space (not just within the Kaspa ecosystem) that can **enhance rather than分流 (divert/siphon) L1's network effects**. Other schemes are, to me, merely distractions. In summary, I dare say I know less about Kaspa L2s than anyone on platform X—test me, I know nothing at all.

## 2025-10-05 Mainnet Stress Test

### (1). Test Conditions and Results

- A 24-hour mainnet stress test was conducted from `2025-10-05 00:00:00` UTC to `2025-10-06 00:00:00` UTC.

- TPS was sustained at over two thousand for extended periods, processing a total of over **158 million** transactions. The mainnet remained stable with no transfer delays.

- In September 2025, Solana processed over 90 million transactions in a day, with real TPS in the thousands, being called the Fastest Chain.

::: tip Conclusion

Kaspa's performance is already sufficient to handle the transaction volume of the Solana ecosystem.

## 2025-10-11 Crypto Market 10.11 Event

Around 5 AM Beijing Time on October 11, due to US-China trade war tensions, the crypto market experienced a flash crash and massive liquidations. Many exchanges experienced lag and an inability to execute stop-loss orders. The final liquidation volume reached $19.2 billion, a record high.

Kaspa also dropped from $0.07 to $0.009 within minutes, later rebounding to around $0.05. Many people were liquidated.

<img :src="$withBase('/kas/2025-10-11_timeline_kas.jpg')" />

During this event, questionable practices by a certain exchange sparked significant backlash and controversy within the industry:

::: tip Lesson

Stay away from leverage trading (futures/contracts), only invest with spare money.
