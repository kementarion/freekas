### **1. Traditional PoW Blockchains Face Performance Bottlenecks**

- Bitcoin (PoW): 1 block every 10 minutes, no smart contract support.

- Ethereum: Pioneered smart contracts but switched from PoW to PoS due to performance limits.

- Solana: Adopted PoS + PoH for high throughput, sacrificed decentralization, and suffered repeated outages.

::: info

All these mainstream cryptocurrencies have obvious technical flaws. Kaspa will change this situation.

### **2. PoS Sparks Decentralization Controversy**

PoS, a compromise to fix PoW’s performance issues, is widely seen as a detour in blockchain development due to its decentralized flaws.

### **3. Kaspa Breaks PoW Limits & Solves the "Blockchain Trilemma"**

- May 2025: Kaspa Crescendo launched, achieving 10 blocks/second (vs. Bitcoin’s 1 block/10 mins).

- October 5, 2025, the mainnet stress test achieved the processing of over 158 million transactions within 24 hours, with TPS ranging from several hundred to several thousand, and the system operated stably and smoothly.

- Key strengths:

  * PoW-based: Inherits and strengthens Bitcoin’s decentralization & security.

  * DAG-powered: Achieved scalability that surpasses Solana.


### **4. Kaspa Supports Layer 2 Smart Contracts**

Sept 2025: Kasplex smart contract platform went live.

Traditional Layer 2 smart contracts are not Kaspa’s goal, because they tend to divert rather than enhance the network effects of Layer 1.


### **5. Kaspa’s Advanced vProg Protocol for Layer 2**

- Proposed by founder Yonatan: The only crypto "L2" architecture that boosts L1 network effects.

- Users can deploy smart contracts directly (no need for traditional L2 platforms).

### **6. Kaspa Secures Miners’ Revenue Post-PoW Block Rewards**

- vProg Protocol: L2 development strengthens L1, and L2 prosperity increases miners’ earnings.

- Future: Miners will rely on transaction fees to maintain network security, ensuring long-term PoW sustainability.

::: tip Summary

Kaspa integrates Bitcoin’s secure consensus, Ethereum’s smart contracts, and Solana’s high throughput. Via a DAG-based PoW protocol, it breaks new ground in blockchain scalability.

Committed to full decentralization and community governance, the project follows a fair launch principle—no pre-mining, no reserves, no VC dominance—making it a true successor to Bitcoin and the Nakamoto Consensus.
